# Math Operations Game
A fun math game created with HTML, CSS and Javascript where the user has to fill in the blank spaces with number or operator (/, *, - or  +) to complete a given equation!

## How It Works
Initially, a start screen is displayed. When the user clicks the start button, we present them with the game screen. The game screen consists of a mathematical equation with a blank space. 

The game goal is for the user to fill in the blank with the appropriate number or operator to complete the equation. Once the user fills in their answer, they click on submit.

Upon clicking the submit button, a result screen is displayed. The result is included along with a restart button on the result screen.
